# Muditext
Multi display code editor to enhance the web development learning experience.

This is a prototype software developed as part of a research project, using a user-centered design methodology to identify issues in web development learning experience with multiple displays.

We implemented a text editor to support web development learning in pairs using multiple displays (e.g. laptops, external displays and phones/tablets).

Muditext uses the following technologies:

- Meteor framework
- MongoDB
- CodeMirror
- Bootstrap
- JQuery
- IronRouter
